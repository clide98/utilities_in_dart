Technical Assignment Challenge: Dart Utilities


This technical assignment challenge is designed to assess a learner's understanding of Dart utilities.


The challenge consists of the following tasks:

Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.
Write a program that uses a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
Create a program that uses a switch statement to check for different string values and output a response based on the value.
Create a program that uses a while loop to print out the numbers from 20 to 10.
Create a program that uses an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd and output the result.
Create a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the largest number in the list.
Write a program that uses a try-catch block to catch an exception and output an error message.


This program defines a function sum to showcase basic utility. It then uses various loops, conditional statements, and error handling mechanisms:

for loop: Iterates from 1 to 10 for printing numbers.
switch statement: Checks the string value and provides responses.
while loop: Iterates from 20 to 10 (descending) for printing numbers.
if-else statement: Checks if a number is even or odd.
List operations: Finds the largest number in a list.
try-catch block: Catches a division by zero exception and displays an error message.
